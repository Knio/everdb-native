Building on Linux:

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

To build with Debugging run cmake as follows:
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Tests can then be run using any of the following:

This calls ctest
$ make test 

CMake Test Runner, executes all test exes and displays a summary
$ ctest

Directly calling the Test exe
$ ./test/Test

This gives the output you would get by calling the exe directly
$ ctest -V
